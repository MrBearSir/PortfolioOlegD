<!--About me information-->      
  <section class="main" id="About me">
        <p>
        Hi. My name is Oleg. I'm getting ready to join the IT comunity and proceed into career of Software Development.<p> I have a "Computer graphics design" background and two years of "Biomedical Engineering" that shaped me into a tech-oriented person.</p>
        </p>
        <p>The curiosity about the possibilities of technology was growing side by side with me from the day i was introduced to cnc machine for the first time in age of 8, since then i always wanted more then i was presented with and had an urge to see what is behind the computer “magic” and to be a part of the process myself.
        </p> 
        <p>
            The introduction into my first primitive coding started from simple macrosses for optimising or altering my gaming experiences and since then I knew that Coding is something that I enjoy working on. 
        </p>
        <P> Graphics-wise I’ve been working with: CorelDraw, Photoshop, Adobe Premier, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Fireworks, Autocad, LightRoom. </P>
        <p>For audio editing I've worked with Adobe Audition, Abelton, Descript.</p>
        <p>Programming languages: Turbo Pascal, html, css, Java Script.</p>
